'''
1) Understand the problem
    - compare two dictionaries (recipes, ingredients)
    - write a function that will return the number of batches that can be made
    - Will the dictionaries always have the same keys and indexes?
    - if one ingredient is less that the recipe needs returns 0
2) Devise a plan
    - iterate through recipe dict and compare it to ingredient dict
    - create a list of comparisons between dict values
3) Carry out plan
4) Looking back
    - i think this is O(n) time
